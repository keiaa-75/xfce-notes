## Noto Sans (Truly universal)

**Rating:** 🌐 🌐 🌐 🌐 🌐

**Project link:** [https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans)

**Not so important notes:**

- Google’s answer to font fragmentation, Noto Sans tries to support everything—and sort of succeeds.
- Clean, neutral, and inoffensive to a fault. It won’t win any beauty contests, but it won’t upset your layout either.
- Great for multilingual setups where things just need to render without tofu.
- If your system's UI ends up looking like a UN conference, this is probably why.

## Inter (Variable/Display)

**Rating:** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 

**Project link:** [https://github.com/rsms/inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter)

**Not so important notes:**

- Inter is what happens when a type designer stares at Apple Human Interface Guidelines for too long—and we’re not mad about it.
- Crisp, polite, and very ‘product design Twitter.’ If your UI starts looking like a Figma prototype, Inter is probably involved.
- Has so many weights and stylistic alternates you’ll start to wonder if you need variable fonts in your life.
- Basically Helvetica’s younger, friendlier cousin who drinks cold brew and uses Tailwind CSS.

## Cantarell (From Gnome, y'know)

**Rating:** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅

**Project link:** [https://cantarell.gnome.org](https://cantarell.gnome.org)

**Not so important notes:**

- The default GNOME font for years — and like most defaults, it never asked to be loved, only tolerated.
- Designed with readability in mind. That’s it. That’s the tweet.
- Soft, polite curves... but not too soft. Like if Helvetica and DejaVu had a socially awkward baby who preferred GTK over Qt.
- Important note: GNOME officially replaced Cantarell with Inter as the default UI font in GNOME 45, meaning even the GNOME devs finally said, *‘it’s not you, it’s variable fonts.’*
- Still, if you miss it, you’re probably either: a) nostalgic, or b) running a distro that hasn't updated GNOME since 2022.
- GNU/GNOME reminder: Yes, it’s free software. Yes, Richard Stallman would want you to respect its freedom — even if you replaced it in your `.gtkrc-2.0` out of spite.

## JetBrains Mono

**Rating:** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

**Project link:** [https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

**Not so important notes:**

- A font made by developers for developers who want their code to feel like a startup pitch deck.
- Has ligatures so elegant they might trick you into rewriting all your Java just to see them in action.
- JetBrains Mono doesn’t just render code—it judges your indentation silently.”
- If fonts had a LinkedIn profile, this one would say ‘Type-safe. Pixel-perfect. Team player.’”
- Pairs well with Nord themes, tiling window managers, and the constant urge to optimize your dev environment instead of actually coding.”
- Switching to it won’t make your code better—but you’ll definitely believe it will.

## Fira Code

**Rating:** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

**Project link:** [https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

**Not so important notes:**

- Powered by dreams, caffeine, and an ungodly amount of `ligatures`. Use responsibly.
- If your code still looks ugly with Fira Code, it's definitely not the font's fault. Just sayin'.
- My therapist told me to embrace my inner developer. So I installed Fira Code. Best decision ever.
- A font so good, even your rubber duck will be impressed. (Probably. Do you have one?)

## Bibata Cursor

**Rating:** ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐

**Project link:** [https://www.bibata.live/](https://www.bibata.live/)

**Not so important notes:**

- Warning: May cause intense feelings of aesthetic superiority. Your other cursors will feel inadequate.
- This cursor has a PhD in looking good. It also judges your messy desktop, but silently.
- If you suddenly feel compelled to organize your life, it's probably Bibata's subtle influence. You're welcome.

## Picom

**Rating:** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 

**Project link:** [https://github.com/yshui/picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)

**Not so important notes:**

- Behold! Picom! The patch you desperately slap on XFCE to make it stop screaming about screen tearing. You're welcome (and I'm sorry you even needed me).
- If your windows are still tearing, it's not my fault. It's your fault for using a display server from the Stone Age. Kidding! (Mostly.)
- My job is to make your desktop look smooth. Like, actually smooth, not 'smooth for XFCE' smooth. There's a difference.
- Consider me the digital equivalent of spackle for your window manager's existential dread. We all have our coping mechanisms.
- I help your windows fade in and out gracefully, because apparently, having them just appear was too shocking for the system. We're all a little sensitive here.

## btop

**Rating:** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅

**Project link:** [https://github.com/aristocratos/btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)

**Not so important notes:**

- Your personal anxiety dashboard. Stare at these numbers long enough and you'll convince yourself your 8GB of RAM is actually 8KB. It's fine. Probably.
- The first place you go when your system feels 'a bit slow' and you're sure it's not the 30 tabs open in Firefox. (It's always the tabs.)
- A comforting reminder that somewhere, something is always chewing on your CPU. Probably a background program you forgot about.
- Or you wanna look cool in `r/unixporn` and your task manager just ain't cutting that slack.

## ColorCursor

**Rating:** 🤪 🤪 🤪

**Project link:** [https://github.com/nozomi-75/ColorCursor/](https://github.com/nozomi-75/ColorCursor/)

**Not so important notes:**

- You're here because you found a cursor theme you loved... on Windows. And you thought, 'Why can't I have that?' Don't worry, we've all made questionable life choices. This tool is just one of them.
- You could just use a native Linux cursor theme. But where's the fun in that? We're here for the chaos, the cross-platform shenanigans, and maybe a little bit of trauma.
- My sole purpose in life is to bridge the unholy gap between your aesthetic desires and your operating system's default settings. It's not a glamorous job, but someone's gotta do it.
- You've found it. The script that answers the question no one asked: 'Can I have my gacha game waifus pointing at my files?' Yes. Yes you can. You magnificent individual.
- You could be productive. You could be working. Instead, you're here, making your cursor a tiny, pixelated Miku. And honestly? I respect that.
- We're translating the very essence of Hatsune Miku's digital sparkle into something that can highlight your `sudo rm -rf` commands. The duality of man.
